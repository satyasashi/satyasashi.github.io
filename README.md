In short folder structure has *VENDORS* which has required files like *CSS, JS, Minified Bootstrap*. This folder is commonly
known to be **Assets**, you can name it whatever you want. But make sure, you change the Reference attributes `href=` in the 
`<link>` tag in `<head></head>` section.

These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
